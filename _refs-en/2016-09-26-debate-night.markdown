On the 2nd of April 2016, Paris City Hall staff organized their first debates night event. This new highlight of local democratic initiatives gathered over 2000 citizens all across the city.
We hosted one of these events at the town hall of the 18th district. Under the name of “open forum”, 50 participants were dispatched into 6 different groups whose reports we published on a [ DemocracyOS instance](http://nuitdesdebatsparis18.herokuapp.com/)..
These workshops were prolonged in the form of a hackathon for [hackathon Open Democracy Now](http://www.opensourcepolitics.eu/refs/2016/09/25/hackathon-mairie18/) Which we hosted during the month of September 2016.
